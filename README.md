This project used html, javascript, and leaflets to create an dynamic visualization graph of the most recent earthquake activity in North America.  The earthquake activty was form the United States Geological Survey (USGS).  

The motivation of this project is utilize D3 interactive graphing function.  In this example, an interactive bubble chart was created which plotted the lack of Healthcare (%) on the Y-axis, but the Poverty level (%) on the X-axis for each state.

Elements of the data.csv file
This file comes from the U.S. Census Bureau.  It is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau.  For this graph, the relation of State (state abbreviation), Lack of Healthcare (%) and Poverty Level (%).

Elements of app.js javascript file 
SVG, or scalable vector graphics,  were defined, for the bubble chart.

Rendering the axis and cirlces based on the variables and dimensions.

D3 Tooltips were used to highlight or "mouseover" and highlight the state abbreviation with plotpoints of Lack of Healthcare and Poverty % observable when mouse is hovering over plotpoint.
