Elements of app.js javascript file 
SVG, or scalable vector graphics,  were defined, for the bubble chart.

Rendering the axis and cirlces based on the variables and dimensions.

D3 Tooltips were used to highlight or "mouseover" and highlight the state abbreviation with plotpoints of Lack of Healthcare and Poverty % observable when mouse is hovering over plotpoint.


Technology/Framework (In order):  
VS Code Editor: HTML (bootstrap, css).  Javascript. Within Javascript: D3 was used to create the interactive visual (bubble chart).   When reviewing the index.html file, needed to review by accessing http.server.
