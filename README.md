This project used html, javascript, and leaflets to create a dynamic visualization graph of the most recent earthquake activity in North America.  The earthquake activty was form the United States Geological Survey (USGS).

The JSON dataset was from the link below: 

https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson

Critical fields of data: earthquake time, place, size, magnitude.

Elements of html and javascript file: D3 was used to access the USGS data.  Leaflet was used to create the color visualizations, overlays on the map to highlight earthquake activity.  The map was accessed using maxbox.com api.

D3 and Leaflet created bubbles over the earthquake activity based on the location, size of earthquake, and magnitude of earthquake (red is highest magnitude, green is lowest).

Technology/Framework (In order):  
VS Code Editor: HTML (css).  Javascript. Within Javascript: D3 and leaflet.  The map was accessed from mapbox.com api.   When reviewing the index.html file, needed to review by accessing http.server.
